\title{Calculate mouse-tracking measures.}
\usage{
mt_measures(data, use = "trajectories", save_as = "measures",
  dimensions = c("xpos", "ypos"), timestamps = "timestamps",
  flip_threshold = 0, verbose = FALSE, show_progress = NULL)

mt_calculate_measures(data, use = "trajectories", save_as = "measures",
  dimensions = c("xpos", "ypos"), timestamps = "timestamps",
  flip_threshold = 0, verbose = FALSE, show_progress = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a mousetrap data object created using one of the mt_import 
functions (see \link{mt_example} for details). Alternatively, a trajectory 
array can be provided directly (in this case \code{use} will be ignored).}

\item{use}{a character string specifying which trajectory data should be 
used.}

\item{save_as}{a character string specifying where the calculated measures 
should be stored.}

\item{dimensions}{a character vector specifying the two dimensions in the 
trajectory array that contain the mouse positions. Usually (and by 
default), the first value in the vector corresponds to the x-positions
(\code{xpos}) and the second to the y-positions (\code{ypos}).}

\item{timestamps}{a character string specifying the trajectory dimension
containing the timestamps.}

\item{flip_threshold}{a numeric value specifying the distance that needs to 
be exceeded in one direction so that a change in direction counts as a
flip.}

\item{verbose}{logical indicating whether function should report its 
progress.}

\item{show_progress}{Deprecated. Please use \code{verbose} instead.}
}
\value{
A mousetrap data object (see \link{mt_example}) where an additional 
  \link{data.frame} has been added (by default called "measures") containing 
  the per-trial mouse-tracking measures. Each row in the data.frame 
  corresponds to one trajectory (the corresponding trajectory is identified 
  via the rownames and, additionally, in the column "mt_id"). Each column in 
  the data.frame corresponds to one of the measures. If a trajectory array 
  was provided directly as \code{data}, only the measures data.frame will be 
  returned.
  
  The following measures are computed for each trajectory (the labels
  relating to x- and y-positions will be adapted depending on the values
  specified in \code{dimensions}):
  \item{mt_id}{Trial ID (can be used for merging measures data.frame with
  other trial-level data)}
  \item{xpos_max}{Maximum x-position} 
  \item{xpos_min}{Minimum x-position}
  \item{ypos_max}{Maximum y-position} 
  \item{ypos_min}{Minimum y-position}
  \item{MAD}{Maximum absolute deviation from the direct path connecting start
  and end point of the trajectory (straight line)}
  \item{MAD_time}{Time at which the maximum absolute deviation was reached
  first}
  \item{MD_above}{Maximum deviation above the direct path} 
  \item{MD_above_time}{Time at which the maximum deviation above was reached 
  first}
  \item{MD_below}{Maximum deviation below the direct path} 
  \item{MD_below_time}{Time at which the maximum deviation below was reached 
  first}
  \item{AD}{Average deviation from direct path}
  \item{AUC}{Area under curve, the geometric area between the actual
  trajectory and the direct path where areas below the direct path have been
  subtracted}
  \item{xpos_flips}{Number of directional changes along x-axis} 
  \item{ypos_flips}{Number of directional changes along y-axis} 
  \item{xpos_reversals}{Number of crossings of the y-axis} 
  \item{ypos_reversals}{Number of crossings of the x-axis}
  \item{RT}{Response time, the total time passed until a response was given}
  \item{initiation_time}{Time passed until first mouse movement was 
  initiated}
  \item{idle_time}{Total time without mouse movement across the entirety of
  the trial}
  \item{total_dist}{Total distance covered by the trajectory}
  \item{vel_max}{Maximum velocity}
  \item{vel_max_time}{Time at which maximum velocity occurred first}
  \item{vel_min}{Minimum velocity} 
  \item{vel_min_time}{Time at which minimum velocity occurred first} 
  \item{acc_max}{Maximum acceleration}
  \item{acc_max_time}{Time at which maximum acceleration occurred first}
  \item{acc_min}{Minimum acceleration} 
  \item{acc_min_time}{Time where minimum acceleration occurred first}
}
\description{
Calculate a number of mouse-tracking measures for each trajectory.
}
\details{
Note that some measures are only returned if distance, velocity and 
acceleration are calculated using \link{mt_derivatives} before 
running \code{mt_measures}. Besides, the meaning of these measures
depends on the values of the arguments in \link{mt_derivatives}.
  
If the deviations from the idealized response trajectory have been calculated
using \link{mt_deviations} before running
\code{mt_measures}, the corresponding data in the trajectory array
will be used. If not, \code{mt_measures} will calculate these
deviations automatically.

The calculation of most measures can be deduced directly from their 
definition (see Value). For several more complex measures, a few details are 
provided in the following.

The \strong{maximum absolute deviation} (\code{MAD}) is the maximum 
perpendicular deviation from the straight path connecting start and end point
of the trajectory (e.g., Freeman & Ambady, 2010). If the \code{MAD} occurs
above the direct path, this is denoted by a positive value. If it occurs
below the direct path, this is denoted by a negative value. This assumes that
the complete movement in the trial was from bottom to top (i.e., the end
point has a higher y-position than the start point). In case the movement was
from top to bottom, \code{mt_measures} automatically flips the
signs. Both \code{MD_above} and  \code{MD_below} are also reported
separately. The \strong{average deviation} (\code{AD}) is the average of all
deviations across the trial.

The \code{AUC} represents the \strong{area under curve}, i.e., the geometric
area between the actual trajectory and the direct path. Areas above the
direct path are added and areas below are subtracted. The \code{AUC} is
calculated using the \link[pracma]{polyarea} function from the pracma
package.
