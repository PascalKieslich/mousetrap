\title{Compute distance matrix.}
\usage{
mt_distmat(
  data,
  use = "ln_trajectories",
  save_as = "distmat",
  dimensions = c("xpos", "ypos"),
  weights = rep(1, length(dimensions)),
  pointwise = TRUE,
  minkowski_p = 2,
  na_rm = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a mousetrap data object created using one of the mt_import
functions (see \link{mt_example} for details). Alternatively, a trajectory
array can be provided directly (in this case \code{use} will be ignored).}

\item{use}{a character string specifying which trajectory data should be
used.}

\item{save_as}{a character string specifying where the resulting data should
be stored.}

\item{dimensions}{a character vector specifying which trajectory variables
should be used. Can be of length 2 or 3 for two-dimensional or
three-dimensional trajectories respectively.}

\item{weights}{numeric vector specifying the relative importance of the
variables specified in \code{dimensions}. Defaults to a vector of 1s
implying equal importance. Technically, each variable is rescaled so that
the standard deviation matches the corresponding value in \code{weights}.
To use the original variables, set \code{weights = NULL}.}

\item{pointwise}{boolean specifying the way dissimilarity between the
trajectories is measured (see Details). If \code{TRUE} (the default),
\code{mt_distmat} measures the average dissimilarity and then sums the
results. If \code{FALSE}, \code{mt_distmat}  measures dissimilarity once
(by treating the various points as independent dimensions).}

\item{minkowski_p}{an integer specifying the distance metric.
\code{minkowski_p = 1} computes the city-block distance, \code{minkowski_p 
  = 2} (the default) computes the Euclidian distance, \code{minkowski_p = 3}
the cubic distance, etc.}

\item{na_rm}{logical specifying whether trajectory points containing NAs
should be removed. Removal is done column-wise. That is, if any trajectory
has a missing value at, e.g., the 10th recorded position, the 10th position
is removed for all trajectories. This is necessary to compute distance
between trajectories.}
}
\value{
A mousetrap data object (see \link{mt_example}) with an additional
object added (by default called \code{distmat}) containing the distance
matrix. If a trajectory array was provided directly as \code{data}, only
the distance matrix will be returned.
}
\description{
Computes the point- or vector-wise dissimilarity between each pair of
trajectories.
}
\details{
\code{mt_distmat} computes point- or vector-wise dissimilarities between
pairs of trajectories. Point-wise dissimilarity refers to computing the
distance metric defined by \code{minkowski_p} for every point of the
trajectory and then summing the results. That is, if \code{minkowski_p = 2}
the point-wise dissimilarity between two trajectories, each defined by a set
of x and y coordinates, is calculated as \code{sum(sqrt((x_i-x_j)^2 + (y_i-y_j)^2))}.
Vector-wise dissimilarity, on the other hand refers to computing the distance
metric once for the entire trajectory. That is, vector-wise dissimilarity is
computed as \code{sqrt(sum((x_i-x_j)^2 + (y_i-y_j)^2))}.
