\title{Calculate sample entropy.}
\usage{
mt_sample_entropy(data, use = "tn_trajectories", save_as = "measures",
  dimension = "xpos", method = "pracma", lag = 3, r = NULL,
  verbose = FALSE, show_progress = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a mousetrap data object created using one of the mt_import 
functions (see \link{mt_example} for details). Alternatively, a trajectory 
array can be provided directly (in this case \code{use} will be ignored).}

\item{use}{a character string specifying which trajectory data should be 
used.}

\item{save_as}{a character string specifying where the calculated measures
should be stored.}

\item{dimension}{a character string specifying the dimension based on which
sample entropy should be calculated. By default (xpos), the x-positions are
used.}

\item{method}{a character string specifying the method used for calculating
sample entropy (see Details).}

\item{lag}{an integer passed on to the sample entropy function (see Details).}

\item{r}{a numeric value passed on to the sample entropy function (see
Details).}

\item{verbose}{logical indicating whether function should report its 
progress.}

\item{show_progress}{Deprecated. Please use \code{verbose} instead.}
}
\value{
A mousetrap data object (see \link{mt_example}).
  
  If a data.frame with label specified in \code{save_as} (by default
  "measures") already exists, the sample entropy values are added as
  additional column(s).
  
  If not, an additional \link{data.frame} will be added.
  
  If a trajectory array was provided directly as \code{data}, only the 
  data.frame will be returned.

\description{
Calculate sample entropy for each trajectory.

\details{
\code{mt_sample_entropy} calculates the sample entropy for each trajectory as
a measure of its complexity. Hehman et al (2015) provide details on how 
sample entropy can be calculated and applied in mouse-tracking (following 
Dale et al., 2007). They apply the sample entropy measure to the x-positions 
(which is also the default here, as in a standard mouse-tracking task with 
buttons located in the top-left and right corners mostly the movements in the
horizontal direction are of interest). Besides, they recommend using the 
time-normalized trajectories so all trajectories have the same length.

Sample entropy is computed by comparing windows of a fixed size (specified 
using \code{lag}) across all recorded positions. Sample entropy is the 
negative natural logarithm of the conditional probability that this windows 
remains similar across the trial (Hehman et al., 2015). A window is 
considered to be similar to another if their distance is smaller than a 
specified tolerance value (which can be specified using \code{r}). Hehman et 
al. (2015) use a tolerance value of 0.2 * standard deviation of all 
differences between adjacent x-positions in the dataset (which is the default
implemented here).

The specific formula for sample entropy depends on the function specified in 
\code{method}. Per default ("pracma"), the \link[pracma]{sample_entropy} 
function from the pracma package is used. Alternatively ("hehman") the 
function by Hehman et al. (2015) is used. Finally, it is also possible to 
calculate sample_entropy values using both functions ("both").
