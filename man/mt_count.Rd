\title{Count number of observations.}
\usage{
mt_count(data, use = "trajectories", save_as = "measures", dimensions = "xpos")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a mousetrap data object created using one of the mt_import
functions (see \link{mt_example} for details). Alternatively, a trajectory
array can be provided directly (in this case \code{use} will be ignored).}

\item{use}{a character string specifying which trajectory data should be
used.}

\item{save_as}{a character string specifying where the resulting trajectory
data should be stored.}

\item{dimensions}{a character vector specifying the name of the dimension(s)
that should be used for counting the number of observations. If several
dimensions are specified, the number of complete observations are reported.}
}
\value{
A mousetrap data object (see \link{mt_example}).

If a data.frame with label specified in \code{save_as} (by default
"measures") already exists, the number of observations (called \code{nobs})
are added as additional column. If not, an additional \link{data.frame}
will be added.

If a trajectory array was provided directly as \code{data}, only a named
character vector will be returned.
}
\description{
Count number of observations per trial for a specified dimension (or several)
in the trajectory array. This is mostly a helper function used by other
functions in this package.

\examples{
# Retrieve vector that counts number of observations
mt_count(mt_example$trajectories)
