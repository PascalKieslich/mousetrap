\title{Import mouse-tracking data saved in long format.}
\usage{
mt_import_long(raw_data, xpos_label = "xpos", ypos_label = "ypos",
  zpos_label = NULL, timestamps_label = "timestamps", add_labels = NULL,
  mt_id_label = "mt_id", mt_seq_label = "mt_seq", reset_timestamps = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{raw_data}{a data.frame in long format, containing the raw data.}

\item{xpos_label}{a character string specifying the column containing the
x-positions.}

\item{ypos_label}{a character string specifying the column containing the
y-positions.}

\item{zpos_label}{an optional character string specifying the column containing the
z-positions.}

\item{timestamps_label}{a character string specifying the column containing 
the timestamps. If no timestamps are found in the data, a timestamps 
variable with increasing integers will be created (assuming equidistant 
time steps).}

\item{add_labels}{a character vector specifying columns containing additional
mouse-tracking variables.}

\item{mt_id_label}{a character string (or vector) specifying the name of the
column that provides a unique ID for every trial (the trial identifier). If
more than one variable name is provided, a new ID variable will be created
by combining the values of each variable. The trial identifier will be set
as the \link{rownames} of the resulting trajectories and trial data, and
additionally be stored in the column "mt_id" in the trial data.}

\item{mt_seq_label}{a character string specifying the column that indicates 
the order of the logged coordinates within a trial. If no column of the 
specified name is found in the data.frame, the coordinates will be imported
in the order in which they were stored in \code{raw_data}.}

\item{reset_timestamps}{logical indicating if the first timestamp should be 
subtracted from all timestamps within a trial. Default is \code{TRUE} as it
is recommended for all following analyses in mousetrap.}

\item{verbose}{logical indicating whether function should report its 
progress.}
}
\value{
A mousetrap data object (see \link{mt_example}).
}
\description{
\code{mt_import_long} receives a data.frame in which mouse-tracking data are 
stored in long format, i.e., where one row contains the logging data 
(timestamp, x- and y-position etc.) at one specific point in the trial. This 
is, for example, the case when exporting the trajectory data from the 
mousetrap package using \link{mt_reshape}. From this data.frame, 
\code{mt_import_long} creates a mousetrap data object containing the 
trajectories and additional data for further processing within the mousetrap 
package. Specifically, it returns a list that includes the trajectory data as
an array (called \code{trajectories}), and all other data as a data.frame
(called \code{data}). This data structure can then be passed on to other
functions within this package, such as \link{mt_time_normalize} or
\link{mt_measures}. The defaults are set so that no adjustments
have to be made when importing a data.frame that was created using
\link{mt_reshape}.
}
\details{
The coordinates are ordered according to the values in the column provided in
the \code{mt_seq_label} parameter (\code{mt_seq} by default). If the 
corresponding column does not exist, the coordinates will be imported in the
order in which they were stored in the raw_data.

If no timestamps are found in the data, \code{mt_import_long} automatically
creates a timestamps variable with increasing integers (starting with 0)
assuming equally spaced sampling intervals.

# Create data in long format for test purposes
mt_data_long <- mt_reshape(mt_example, use2_variables="Condition")

# Import the data using mt_import_long
mt_data <- mt_import_long(mt_data_long)


\dontrun{
# Import a hypothetical dataset that contains the
# custom mouse-tracking variables angle and velocity
mt_data <- mt_import_long(exp_data,
  add_labels= c("angle", "velocity"))
