\title{A mousetrap data object.}
\format{A mousetrap data object is a \link{list} containing  at least the
  following objects:
  \itemize{
    \item{\code{data}: a \link{data.frame} containing the trial data (from 
    which the mouse-tracking data columns have been removed). More 
    information about the content of the trial data in \code{mt_example} can 
    be found in \link{mt_example_raw}. The \link{rownames} of \code{data} 
    correspond to the trial identifier. For convenience, the trial identifier
    is also stored in an additional column called "mt_id".}
    \item{\code{trajectories}: an \link{array} containing the raw 
    mouse-tracking trajectories. The first dimension represents the different
    trials and the dimension names (which can be assessed using 
    \link{rownames}) correspond to the trial identifier (the same identifier 
    that is used as the \code{rownames} in \code{data}). The second dimension
    corresponds to the different mouse-tracking variables (timestamps, 
    x-positions, y-positions) which are usually called \code{timestamps}, 
    \code{xpos}, and \code{ypos}. The third dimension corresponds to the 
    samples taken over time which are included in chronological order.}
  }

  Some functions in this package (e.g., \link{mt_time_normalize} and
  \link{mt_average}) add additional trajectory arrays (e.g.,
  \code{tn_trajectories} and \code{av_trajectories}) to the mousetrap data
  object. Other functions modify the existing arrays (e.g.,
  \link{mt_derivatives} adds distance, velocity, and acceleration
  to an existing dataset). Finally \link{mt_measures} adds an
  additional data.frame with mouse-tracking measures to it.}

\description{
A mousetrap data object with example data created by importing
\link{mt_example_raw} and applying basic post-processing.
}
\details{
The raw data set was imported using \link{mt_import_mousetrap}. Trajectories 
were then remapped using \link{mt_remap_symmetric} so that all trajectories 
end in the top-left corner and their starting point was aligned using
\link{mt_align_start} to a common value (0,0).
