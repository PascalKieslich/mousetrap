\title{Remap mouse trajectories.}
\usage{
mt_remap_symmetric(data, use = "trajectories", save_as = use,
  dimensions = c("xpos", "ypos"), remap_xpos = "left", remap_ypos = "up")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a mousetrap data object created using one of the mt_import 
functions (see \link{mt_example} for details). Alternatively, a trajectory 
array can be provided directly (in this case \code{use} will be ignored).}

\item{use}{a character string specifying which trajectory data should be 
used.}

\item{save_as}{a character string specifying where the resulting trajectory 
data should be stored.}

\item{dimensions}{a character vector specifying the two dimensions in the 
trajectory array that contain the mouse positions, the first value
corresponding to the x-positions, the second to the y-positions.}

\item{remap_xpos}{character string indicating the direction in which to remap
values on the x axis. If set to "left" (as per default), trajectories with 
an endpoint on the right (i.e. with a positive x-value) will be remapped to
the left. The alternatives are "right" which has the reverse effect, and 
"no", which disables remapping on the horizontal dimension.}

\item{remap_ypos}{character string defining whether tracks directed downwards
on the y axis should be remapped so that they end with a positive y value. 
This will be performed if this parameter is set to "up" (which is the 
default), and the reverse occurs if the parameter is set to "down". If it 
is set to "no", y-values remain untouched.}
}
\value{
A mousetrap data object (see \link{mt_example}) with remapped 
  trajectories. If the trajectory array was provided directly as \code{data},
  only the trajectory array will be returned.
}
\description{
Remap all trajectories to one side (or one quadrant) of the coordinate 
system. In doing so, \code{mt_remap_symmetric} assumes a centered coordinate 
system and a symmetric design of the response buttons (see Details).
}
\details{
When mouse trajectories are compared across different conditions, it is 
typically desirable that the endpoints of the trajectories share the same 
direction (e.g., diagonally up and left). This way, the trajectories can be 
compared regardless of the button they were directed at.

\code{mt_remap_symmetric} can be used to achieve this provided that two 
assumptions hold:

First, this function assumes a centered coordinate system, i.e. the 
coordinate system is centered on the screen center. This is the case when the
data is produced by the mousetrap plug-ins in OpenSesame.

Second, it assumes that the response buttons in the mouse-tracking experiment
are symmetric, in that they all are equally distant from the screen center.

\examples{
# Remap trajectories so that all trajectories
# end in the top-left corner
mt_example <- mt_import_mousetrap(mt_example_raw)
mt_example <- mt_remap_symmetric(mt_example)

# Only flip trajectories vertically so that all
# trajectories end in the upper half of the screen
mt_example <- mt_import_mousetrap(mt_example_raw)
mt_example <- mt_remap_symmetric(mt_example,
  remap_xpos="no", remap_ypos="up")
