\title{Import mouse-tracking data saved in wide format.}
\usage{
mt_import_wide(raw_data, xpos_label = "X", ypos_label = "Y",
  zpos_label = NULL, timestamps_label = "T", add_labels = NULL,
  mt_id_label = NULL, pos_sep = "_", pos_ids = NULL,
  reset_timestamps = TRUE, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{raw_data}{a data.frame containing the raw data.}

\item{xpos_label}{a character string specifying the core of the column labels
containing the x-positions (e.g., "X" for "X_1", "X_2", ...).}

\item{ypos_label}{a character string specifying the core of the column labels
containing the y-positions (e.g., "Y" for "Y_1", "Y_2", ...).}

\item{zpos_label}{a character string specifying the core of the column labels
containing the z-positions.}

\item{timestamps_label}{an optional character string specifying the core of 
the column labels containing the timestamps. If no timestamps are found in
the data, a timestamps variable with increasing integers will be created
(assuming equidistant time steps).}

\item{add_labels}{a character vector specifying the core of columns
containing additional mouse-tracking variables.}

\item{mt_id_label}{an optional character string (or vector) specifying the 
name of the column that provides a unique ID for every trial (the trial 
identifier). If unspecified (the default), an ID variable will be 
generated. If more than one variable name is provided, a new ID variable 
will be created by combining the values of each variable. The trial 
identifier will be set as the \link{rownames} of the resulting trajectories
and trial data, and additionally be stored in the column "mt_id" in the 
trial data.}

\item{pos_sep}{a character string indicating the character that connects the
core label and the position, (e.g., "_" for "X_1", "Y_1", ...).}

\item{pos_ids}{the vector of IDs used for indexing the x-coordinates, 
y-coordinates etc. (e.g., 1:101 for time-normalized trajectories from 
MouseTracker). If unspecified (the default), column labels for the
respective variable will be extracted using grep (see Details).}

\item{reset_timestamps}{logical indicating if the first timestamp should be 
subtracted from all timestamps within a trial. Default is \code{TRUE} as it
is recommended for all following analyses in mousetrap.}

\item{verbose}{logical indicating whether function should report its 
progress.}
}
\value{
A mousetrap data object (see \link{mt_example}).
}
\description{
\code{mt_import_wide} receives a data.frame where mouse-tracking data are 
stored in wide format, i.e., where one row contains the data of one trial and
every recorded mouse position and variable is saved in a separate variable 
(e.g., X_1, X_2, ..., Y_1, Y_2, ...). This is, e.g., the case when exporting 
trajectories from MouseTracker (Freeman & Ambady, 2010). From this 
data.frame, \code{mt_import_wide} creates a mousetrap data object containing 
the trajectories and additional data for further processing within the 
mousetrap package. Specifically, it returns a list that includes the 
trajectory data as an array (called \code{trajectories}), and all other data 
as a data.frame (called \code{data}). This data structure can then be passed 
on to other functions within this package, such as \link{mt_time_normalize} 
or \link{mt_measures}.
}
\details{
\code{mt_import_wide} is designed to import mouse-tracking data saved in a
wide format. The defaults are set so that usually only the \code{raw_data}
and \code{pos_ids} need to be provided when importing trajectory data that
stem from a "time normalized analysis" in MouseTracker (Freeman & Ambady,
2010).

If no \code{pos_ids} are provided, column labels for the respective variable 
(e.g., x-positions) are extracted using \link{grep} returning all variables 
that start with the respective character string (e.g., "X_" if
\code{xpos_label="ypos"} and \code{pos_sep="_"}). This is, e.g., useful when 
importing trajectory data that stem from a "raw time analysis" in 
MouseTracker (Freeman & Ambady, 2010).

If no timestamps are found in the data, \code{mt_import_wide} automatically 
creates a timestamps variable with increasing integers (starting with 0) 
assuming equally spaced sampling intervals.
