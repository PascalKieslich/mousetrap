\title{Exclude initial phase without mouse movement.}
\usage{
mt_exclude_initiation(data, use = "trajectories", save_as = use,
  dimensions = c("xpos", "ypos"), timestamps = "timestamps",
  reset_timestamps = TRUE, verbose = FALSE, show_progress = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a mousetrap data object created using one of the mt_import 
functions (see \link{mt_example} for details). Alternatively, a trajectory 
array can be provided directly (in this case \code{use} will be ignored).}

\item{use}{a character string specifying which trajectory data should be 
used.}

\item{save_as}{a character string specifying where the resulting trajectory 
data should be stored.}

\item{dimensions}{a character vector specifying the dimensions in the 
trajectory array that contain the mouse positions.}

\item{timestamps}{a character string specifying the trajectory dimension
containing the timestamps.}

\item{reset_timestamps}{logical indicating whether the timestamps should be 
reset after removing the initial phase without movement (see Details).}

\item{verbose}{logical indicating whether function should report its 
progress.}

\item{show_progress}{Deprecated. Please use \code{verbose} instead.}
}
\value{
A mousetrap data object (see \link{mt_example}) from which the 
  initial phase without mouse movement was removed. If the trajectory array
  was provided directly as \code{data}, only the trajectory array will be
  returned.
}
\description{
Exclude the initial phase in a trial where the mouse was not moved. The 
corresponding samples (x- and y-positions and timestamps) in the trajectory 
data will be removed.
}
\details{
\code{mt_exclude_initiation} removes all samples (x- and y-positions as well 
as timestamps) at the beginning of the trial during which the mouse was not 
moved from its initial position. The last unchanged sample is retained in the
data.

If \code{reset_timestamps == TRUE} (the default), it subtracts the last
timestamp before a movement occurs from all timestamps , so that the series
of timestamps once more begin with zero. If the argument is set to
\code{FALSE}, the values of the timestamps are unchanged.

Please note that resetting the timestamps will result in changes in several 
mouse-tracking measures, notably those which report timestamps (e.g., 
\code{MAD_time}). Typically, however, these changes are desired when using
this function.
