\title{Import mouse-tracking data recorded using the mousetrap plug-ins in
OpenSesame.}
\usage{
mt_import_mousetrap(raw_data, xpos_label = "xpos", ypos_label = "ypos",
  timestamps_label = "timestamps", mt_id_label = NULL, split = ",",
  duplicates = "remove_first", reset_timestamps = TRUE, verbose = FALSE,
  show_progress = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{raw_data}{a data.frame containing the raw data.}

\item{xpos_label}{a character string specifying the name of the column(s) in
which the x-positions are stored (see Details).}

\item{ypos_label}{a character string specifying the name of the column(s) in
which the y-positions are stored (see Details).}

\item{timestamps_label}{a character string specifying the name of the column(s)
in which the timestamps are stored (see Details).}

\item{mt_id_label}{an optional character string (or vector) specifying the 
name of the column that provides a unique ID for every trial (the trial 
identifier). If unspecified (the default), an ID variable will be 
generated. If more than one variable name is provided, a new ID variable 
will be created by combining the values of each variable. The trial 
identifier will be set as the \link{rownames} of the resulting trajectories
and trial data, and additionally be stored in the column "mt_id" in the 
trial data.}

\item{split}{a character string indicating how the different timestamps and 
coordinates within a trial are separated.}

\item{duplicates}{a character string indicating how duplicate timestamps
within a trial are handled (see Details).}

\item{reset_timestamps}{logical indicating if the first timestamp should be 
subtracted from all timestamps within a trial. Default is \code{TRUE} as it
is recommended for all following analyses in mousetrap.}

\item{verbose}{logical indicating whether function should report its 
progress.}

\item{show_progress}{Deprecated. Please use \code{verbose} instead.}
}
\value{
A mousetrap data object (see \link{mt_example}).

  If mouse-tracking data were recorded using the mousetrap plug-ins for
  OpenSesame, the unit of the timestamps is milliseconds.
}
\description{
\code{mt_import_mousetrap} accepts a data.frame of (merged) raw data from a 
mouse-tracking experiment implemented in OpenSesame using one of the 
\href{https://github.com/pascalkieslich/mousetrap-os}{mousetrap plug-ins}. 
From this data.frame, \code{mt_import_mousetrap} creates a mousetrap data 
object containing the trajectories and additional data for further processing
within the mousetrap package. Specifically, it returns a list that includes
the trajectory data as an array (called \code{trajectories}), and all other
data as a data.frame (called \code{data}). This data structure can then be
passed on to other functions within this package, such as
\link{mt_time_normalize} or \link{mt_measures}.
}
\details{
When working with mouse-tracking data that were recorded using the mousetrap
plug-ins for OpenSesame, usually only the \code{raw_data} need to be
provided. All other arguments have sensible defaults.

If the relevant timestamps, x-positions, and y-positions are each stored in 
one variable, a character string specifying (parts of) the respective column 
name needs to be provided. In this case, the column names are extracted using
\link{grep} to find the column that starts with the respective character 
string (in OpenSesame these will typically contain the name of the item that
was used to record them, such as \code{xpos_get_response}). This means that
the exact column names do not have to be provided - as long as only one 
column starts with the respective character string (otherwise, the exact 
column names have to be provided).

If several variables contain the timestamps, x-positions, and y-positions 
within a trial (e.g., \code{xpos_part1} and \code{xpos_part2}), a vector of 
the exact column names has to be provided (e.g., 
\code{xpos_label=c("xpos_part1","xpos_part2"))}. \code{mt_import_mousetrap} 
will then merge all raw data in the order with which the variable labels have
been specified. If one variable contains NAs or an empty string in a trial, 
these cases will be ignored (this covers the special case that, e.g., 
\code{xpos_part2} is only relevant for some trials and contains NAs in the 
other trials).

\code{duplicates} allows for different options to handle duplicate timestamps
within a trial: \itemize{ \item{\code{remove_first}: First timestamp and
corresponding x-/y-positions are removed (the default).}
\item{\code{remove_last}: Last timestamp and corresponding x-/y-positions are
removed.} \item{\code{ignore}: Duplicates are kept.} }
