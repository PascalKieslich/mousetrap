\title{Calculate movement angles.}
\usage{
mt_angles(
  data,
  use = "trajectories",
  dimensions = c("xpos", "ypos"),
  save_as = use,
  na_replace = FALSE,
  unit = "radian",
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a mousetrap data object created using one of the mt_import
functions (see \link{mt_example} for details). Alternatively, a trajectory
array can be provided directly (in this case \code{use} will be ignored).}

\item{use}{a character string specifying which trajectory data should be
used.}

\item{dimensions}{a character string specifying which trajectory variables
should be used. Must be of length 2.}

\item{save_as}{a character string specifying where the resulting trajectory
data should be stored.}

\item{na_replace}{logical specifying whether \code{NA}s in the angle values
should be replaced using the next existing angle value (see Details).
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{unit}{character specifying the unit for the angles. Default is
"radian", alternative is "degree".}

\item{verbose}{logical indicating whether function should report its
progress.}
}
\value{
A mousetrap data object (see \link{mt_example}) with point-based and
vertical-based angles added as additional variables to the trajectory array
(called \code{angle_p} and \code{angle_v}). If a trajectory array was
provided directly as \code{data}, only the trajectory array will be
returned.
}
\description{
Calculate point-based and vertical-based angles for the points in the
movement trajectory. Point-based angles are the angle defined by three
subsequent points on the trajectory. Vertical-based angles are the angles
between two subsequent points and the vertical axis.
}
\details{
By default, angles are reported in radians, the alternative is degrees. For
the first point in a trajectory, the angle values are always not defined
(\code{NA}).

For vertical-based angles (\code{angle_v}), positive values indicate a
movement to the left of the vertical, negative values to the right of the
vertical. If there was no movement across two consecutive points,
\code{angle_v} is not defined and, by default, \code{NA} is returned. If
\code{na_replace} is \code{TRUE}, the next existing angle value is reported
instead.

For point-based angles (\code{angle_p}), angles indicate changes of movement
within three consecutive time steps. The reported angle is always the smaller
one. A value of pi (= 3.14...) (for radians) or 180 (for degrees) indicates a
constant movement direction, a value of 0 (both for radians and degrees) a
complete reversal. If there was no movement across two consecutive points,
\code{angle_p} is not defined and, by default, \code{NA} is returned. If
\code{na_replace} is \code{TRUE}, the next existing angle value is reported
instead. \code{angle_p} is also not defined for the last point of the
trajectory.

# Calculate movement angles
mt_example <- mt_angles(mt_example)

# Calculate movement angles (in degree)
# and replace NAs with next existing value
