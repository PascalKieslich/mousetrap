\title{Calculate deviations from idealized trajectory.}
\usage{
mt_deviations(data, use = "trajectories", save_as = use,
  dimensions = c("xpos", "ypos"), start_ideal = NULL, end_ideal = NULL,
  prefix = "", verbose = FALSE, show_progress = NULL)

mt_calculate_deviations(data, use = "trajectories", save_as = use,
  dimensions = c("xpos", "ypos"), start_ideal = NULL, end_ideal = NULL,
  prefix = "", verbose = FALSE, show_progress = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a mousetrap data object created using one of the mt_import 
functions (see \link{mt_example} for details). Alternatively, a trajectory 
array can be provided directly (in this case \code{use} will be ignored).}

\item{use}{a character string specifying which trajectory data should be 
used.}

\item{save_as}{a character string specifying where the resulting trajectory 
data should be stored.}

\item{dimensions}{a character vector specifying the two dimensions in the
trajectory array that contain the mouse positions. By default 
(\code{c("xpos","ypos")}), the x- and y-positions are used.}

\item{start_ideal}{an optional vector specifying the start position (see
Example). If specified, this position will be used as the starting point of
the idealized trajectory (instead of the actual starting point).}

\item{end_ideal}{an optional vector specifying the end position (see
Example). If specified, this position will be used as the end point of the
idealized trajectory (instead of the actual end point).}

\item{prefix}{an optional character string that is added as a prefix to the 
to be created new trajectory dimensions.}

\item{verbose}{logical indicating whether function should report its 
progress.}

\item{show_progress}{Deprecated. Please use \code{verbose} instead.}
}
\value{
A mousetrap data object (see \link{mt_example}) where the positions 
  of the idealized trajectory (by default called \code{xpos_ideal} and 
  \code{ypos_ideal}) and the perpendicular deviations of the actual 
  trajectory from the idealized trajectory (by default called 
  \code{dev_ideal}) have been added as additional columns to the trajectory
  array. If the trajectory array was provided directly as \code{data}, only
  the trajectory array will be returned.
}
\description{
Calculate the idealized trajectory and the perpendicular deviations of the
actual trajectory from it for each logged position.
}
\details{
The idealized trajectory is defined as the straight line connecting the start
and end point of the actual trajectory (e.g., Freeman & Ambady, 2010). The 
deviation for each position is calclated as the perpendicular deviation of 
the actual trajectory from the idealized trajectory.

If a deviation occurs above the direct path, this is denoted by a positive 
value. If it occurs below the direct path, this is denoted by a negative 
value. This assumes that the complete movement in the trial was from bottom 
to top (i.e., the end point has a higher y-position than the start poins). In
case the movement was from top to bottom, \code{mt_deviations} 
automatically flips the signs. Note that the second dimension specified in 
\code{dimensions} is used for determining all this.
