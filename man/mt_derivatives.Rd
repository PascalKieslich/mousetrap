\usage{
mt_derivatives(data, use = "trajectories", save_as = use,
  dimensions = c("xpos", "ypos"), timestamps = "timestamps", prefix = "",
  acc_on_abs_vel = FALSE, verbose = FALSE, show_progress = NULL,

  dimension = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a mousetrap data object created using one of the mt_import 
functions (see \link{mt_example} for details). Alternatively, a trajectory 
array can be provided directly (in this case \code{use} will be ignored).}

\item{use}{a character string specifying which trajectory data should be 
used.}

\item{save_as}{a character string specifying where the resulting trajectory 
data should be stored.}

\item{dimensions}{a character vector specifying across which dimension(s) 
distances, velocity, and acceleration are calculated. By default 
(\code{c("xpos","ypos")}), they are calculated across both x and y 
dimensions. Alternatively, only one dimesion can be specified, e.g., 
\code{"xpos"} or \code{"ypos"}.}

\item{timestamps}{a character string specifying the trajectory dimension
containing the timestamps.}

\item{prefix}{an optional character string that is added as a prefix to the 
to be created new trajectory dimensions.}

\item{acc_on_abs_vel}{logical indicating if acceleration should be calculated
based on absolute velocity values (ignoring direction). Only relevant if 
velocity can be negative (see Details).}

\item{verbose}{logical indicating whether function should report its 
progress.}

\item{show_progress}{Deprecated. Please use \code{verbose} instead.}

\item{dimension}{Deprecated. Please use \code{dimensions} instead.}
}
\value{
A mousetrap data object (see \link{mt_example}) with Euclidian 
  distance, velocity, and acceleration added as additional columns to the 
  trajectory array (called \code{dist}, \code{vel}, and  \code{acc}, if no 
  prefix was specified). If the trajectory array was provided directly as 
  \code{data}, only the trajectory array will be returned.
}
\description{
Calculate distance traveled, velocity, and acceleration for each logged 
position. Distance is calculated as the Euclidean distance between successive
coordinates, and velocity as distance covered per time interval. The 
acceleration denotes the difference in velocity, again normalized per time.
}
\details{
Distances, velocities and acceleration are computed as follows:

The first entry in each respective vector is always zero. Each subsequent 
entry thus represents the Euclidean distance traveled since the previous 
recorded set of coordinates and the velocity with which the movement between 
both samples took place. Thus, both distance and velocity represent the 
intervening period between the previous sample and the one with which the 
numeric value is saved.

The acceleration, by contrast, denotes the change in velocity between two 
adjacent periods. Because of this, it is shifted forward to best match the 
actual time point at which the acceleration was measured. Because there will 
always be one less value computed for acceleration than for velocity, the 
final value in the acceleration vector has been padded with an NA. To 
reconstruct the velocity from the acceleration, multiply the acceleration 
vector with the sampling interval, compute the cumulative sum of the result, 
and add a zero at the beginning.

If the distance is calculated across both horizontal and vertical (x and y) 
dimensions, distance and velocity is always positive (or 0). If only one
dimension is used, increases in x (or y) values result in positive distances
and velocity values, decreases in negative distances and velocity values.
