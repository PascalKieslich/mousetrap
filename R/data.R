#' Raw mouse-tracking dataset for demonstrations of the mousetrap package
#'
#' An exemplary mouse-tracking dataset collected 
#' \href{https://osdoc.cogsci.nl/}{OpenSesame} using the 
#' \href{https://github.com/pascalkieslich/mousetrap-os}{mousetrap plugin} 
#' (Kieslich & Henninger, 2017). A preprocessed (as opposed to raw) version of
#' the same data can be found in \link{mt_example}.
#'
#' The data stem from a study based on experiment 1 by Dale et al. (2007). In
#' this experiment, participants have to assign exemplars (e.g., "shark") to one
#' of two categories (e.g., "fish" or "mammal") by clicking on the button
#' corresponding to the correct category. All exemplars and categories were
#' translated to and presented in German.
#'
#' Across the 19 trials of the experiment, participants categorized 13 exemplars
#' that were typical of their category and 6 atypical exemplars for which this
#' was not the case. For the atypical exemplars (e.g., "whale"), the competing
#' category ("fish") was selected to compete with the correct category
#' ("mammal"). The hypothesis under investigation is whether participants' mouse
#' trajectories deviate more towards the competing category for the atypical
#' exemplars, indicating increased conflict between the response options.
#'
#' Please note that \code{mt_example_raw} should only be used for exploring the
#' features of the mousetrap package and not for any substantive analysis.

#' Mouse trajectory prototypes.
#'
#' A core set of five mouse trajectory prototypes including the 'straight'
#' trajectory, the mildly curved trajectory, the continuous change-of-mind
#' trajectory, the discrete change-of-mind trajectory, and the double discrete
#' change-of-mind trajectory.
#' 
#' Mouse- and hand-trajectories often occur in types. In such cases, movement
#' trajectory data should be analyzed in terms of discrete type assignments
#' (Wulff et al., 2023). To this end \link{mt_map} can be used to map mouse- or
#' hand-trajectory to the closest of several predefined prototypes.
#' \code{mt_prototypes} provides a core set of prototypes that has been shown to
#' represent well a large fraction of empirical movement trajectories (Wulff et
#' al., 2022).
#' 
#' To tailor the set of prototypes to a given study, \code{mt_prototypes} can be
#' extended using \link{mt_add_trajectory}.
