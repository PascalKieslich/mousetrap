#' Calculate distance, velocity, and acceleration.
#' 
#' Calculate distance traveled, velocity, and acceleration for each logged 
#' position. Distance is calculated as the Euclidean distance between successive
#' coordinates, and velocity as distance covered per time interval. The 
#' acceleration denotes the difference in velocity, again normalized per time.
#' 
#' Distances, velocities and acceleration are computed as follows:
#' 
#' The first entry in each respective vector is always zero. Each subsequent 
#' entry thus represents the Euclidean distance traveled since the previous 
#' recorded set of coordinates and the velocity with which the movement between 
#' both samples took place. Thus, both distance and velocity represent the 
#' intervening period between the previous sample and the one with which the 
#' numeric value is saved.
#' 
#' The acceleration, by contrast, denotes the change in velocity between two 
#' adjacent periods. Because of this, it is shifted forward to best match the 
#' actual time point at which the acceleration was measured. Because there will 
#' always be one less value computed for acceleration than for velocity, the 
#' final value in the acceleration vector has been padded with an NA. To 
#' reconstruct the velocity from the acceleration, multiply the acceleration 
#' vector with the sampling interval, compute the cumulative sum of the result, 
#' and add a zero at the beginning.
#' 
#' If the distance is calculated across both horizontal and vertical (x and y) 
#' dimensions, distance and velocity is always positive (or 0). If only one
#' dimension is used, increases in x (or y) values result in positive distances
#' and velocity values, decreases in negative distances and velocity values.
#' 
#' @inheritParams mt_time_normalize
#' @param dimensions a character vector specifying across which dimension(s) 
#'   distances, velocity, and acceleration are calculated. By default 
#'   (\code{c("xpos","ypos")}), they are calculated across both x and y 
#'   dimensions. Alternatively, only one dimesion can be specified, e.g., 
#'   \code{"xpos"} or \code{"ypos"}.
#' @param timestamps a character string specifying the trajectory dimension
#'   containing the timestamps.
#' @param prefix an optional character string that is added as a prefix to the 
#'   to be created new trajectory dimensions.
#' @param acc_on_abs_vel logical indicating if acceleration should be calculated
#'   based on absolute velocity values (ignoring direction). Only relevant if 
#'   velocity can be negative (see Details).
#' @param dimension Deprecated. Please use \code{dimensions} instead.
#' 
#' @return A mousetrap data object (see \link{mt_example}) with Euclidian 
#'   distance, velocity, and acceleration added as additional columns to the 
#'   trajectory array (called \code{dist}, \code{vel}, and  \code{acc}, if no 
#'   prefix was specified). If the trajectory array was provided directly as 
#'   \code{data}, only the trajectory array will be returned.
#'   
#' @seealso \link{mt_average} for averaging trajectories across constant time
#' intervals.
#' 
#' \link{mt_measures} for calculating per-trial mouse-tracking
#' measures.
